As with all SmallBasic extensions, copy the extension dll and xml to a lib sub-folder of the SmallBasic installation folder, usually in one of the following locations:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Small Basic\lib
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Small Basic\lib

You may require to create the lib folder if it doesn't exist.

The required lib folder files are:

LitDev.dll
LitDev.xlm
LitDev.De.xml (optional German intellisense)

Copy ALL other files (documentation and samples) elsewhere.
